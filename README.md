# BrainROS

This is a demo program for BrainROS, which contains a short autonomous run and the corresponding movement functions.

This project was created using ProsV5 version 3.2.2. If your version of Pros is different, please first create a new project then copy in the main.cpp and demos.cpp in the src folder. The existing main.cpp file located in the src folder will need to be replaced. Please also copy in the main.h and demos.h files into the include folder, keeping in mind that the existing main.h file will also need to be replaced.
